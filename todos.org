Martin D. Metodiev, Rory T. Steven, Xavier Loizeau, Zoltan Takats, and Josephine Bunch, /Modality Agnostic Model for Spatial Resolution in Mass Spectrometry Imaging: Application to MALDI MSI Data/, Anal. Chem. 2021, [[doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02470][doi]].

_Aim:_ to determine spatial resolution of MS images.
The spatial resolution is understood as something different than the pixel size, here. The matrix is consumed, where the information can overlap between pixels. When the pixel size is lower than the laser crater diameter, the spatial resolution is greater than the pixel size.

In previous works, the authors use a scaled bar distance [[doi:10.1002/rcm.7191][[1]â€‹]].
