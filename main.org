*** Sparse matrices.
Large centroided MS images cannot fit in memory. The majority of the values in the MS images are zeroes. One approach is to use /sparse matrices/, where only nonzero datapoints are stored.

Approach:
**** DONE Sparse matrices with same operations as numpy's ndarray
CLOSED: <2021-10-01 Fri 12:05>

#+begin_src python
  import sparse

  #redefine numpy's ndarray operations
  def __gt__(...):
      pass

  def transpose(...):
      pass

  def __getitem__(...):
      pass
#+end_src
**** DONE Class enclosing the MS Image
CLOSED: <2021-10-08 Fri 12:19>

Operations on both the spectra and the image
#+begin_src python
  class MSImageImplementation:
      def __init__(self, image, spectra):
          self.image = image
          self.spectra = spectra

      #redefine various operations working on both spectra and images

#+end_src
**** DONE Transparent integration
CLOSED: <2021-10-29 Fri 12:05>

 Choose the appropriate type for the MS image depending on whether the data is centroided or profile.
#+begin_src python
  class MSImage:
        "
        Allows to create an MS image type
        with the appropriate np.ndarray or
        sparse matrix type
        "

        def __init__(self, image, ...):
            # determines the appropriate type
            image = which_type(image)
            return MSImageImplementation(image, ...)
#+end_src

*** Efficient input/output
Centroided images with high spatial resolution still do not fit in memory.
We need to read the images *on the fly*, in a time-efficient manner.

Approach:
**** TODO Integration in  ~MSImageImplementation~
** Registration
*** Fiducial landmarks

** Correlation

* Teaching
