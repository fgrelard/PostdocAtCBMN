#+title: Learning Representations By Back-Propagating Errors

MLP: Multiple Layer [[id:77579a0f-b93f-40ad-8653-c0f80439496e][Perceptron]]

Multiple layers: layers of neurons. Each layer is fully connected to the next.

Activation function: sigmoid, in order to map the node's output non linearly in the range $[0, 1]$.
