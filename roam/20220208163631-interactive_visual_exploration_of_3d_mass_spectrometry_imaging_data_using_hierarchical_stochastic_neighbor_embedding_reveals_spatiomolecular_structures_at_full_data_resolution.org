_Previous works_: Traditional dimension reduction techniques (PCA, NMF) are limited because of their linearity constraint which highlights differences between consecutive slices.
Motivates the need for non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as [[id:e95fd377-dd05-4363-8eca-b00b003524ff][SNE]].
