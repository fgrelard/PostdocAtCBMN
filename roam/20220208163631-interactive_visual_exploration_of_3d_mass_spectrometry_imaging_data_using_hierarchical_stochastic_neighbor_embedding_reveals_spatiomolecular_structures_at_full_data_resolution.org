#+title: Interactive visual exploration of 3d mass spectrometry imaging data using hierarchical stochastic neighbor embedding reveals spatiomolecular structures at full data resolution

_Previous works_: Traditional dimension reduction techniques (PCA, NMF) are limited because of their linearity constraint which highlights differences between consecutive slices.
Motivates the need for non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as [[id:e95fd377-dd05-4363-8eca-b00b003524ff][SNE]]. 

â†’ Working with [[id:e48f89e0-263b-4dbe-ab29-70bd981d2312][HSNE]].

The HSNE is used to:
1. Identify anatomical structures by clustering in the HSNE scatter plot 
2. Identify ions which are most associated to each segmentation map (i.e. cluster)
