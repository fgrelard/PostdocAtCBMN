_DeepeR_:
1. Denoising, reconstruction of low signal-to-noise ratio images
2. Super-resolution (2-4 times better resolution)
3. Transfer learning: from cell to tissue scaling

_Intro:_
Raman: prohibitive acquisition times for high spatial resolution.
Previously, deep learning is used for segmentation of Raman images, identification of species in images.
Complex spatial and spectral correlations in images justify the use of deep learning.

⚠ How *general* can this workflow be?

In both cases, data augmentation was done.
* Denoising
Denoising was achieved with a 1D ResUNet.

* Super-resolution
Super-resolution was achieved with a residual channel attention network.
Evaluation by PSNR and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

2x *spectral* downsampling early in the network, followed by 2x upsampling at the end.

Both the networks are applied sequentially.

* Generalizability
Transfer learning.
Two previous networks applied to hyperspectral Raman images from different origins, with very different information.
New training of the HySISR network achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods, as well as the application of the original network and weights directly.

_Limitations:_
- Cannot reconstruct very fine details
- Cannot be applied to another Raman dataset with significant chemical discrepancies → need to expand training dataset
- No extensive validation
