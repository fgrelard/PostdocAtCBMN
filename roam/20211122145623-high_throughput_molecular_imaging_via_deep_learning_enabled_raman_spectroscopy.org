#+title: High-throughput molecular imaging via deep-learning-enabled raman spectroscopy

[[id:e28dff04-92c1-46c1-9649-1215749d4542][literature]] [[id:25ea27df-6151-474f-814c-d1b3657282fa][deep learning]]

_DeepeR_:
1. Denoising, reconstruction of low signal-to-noise ratio images
2. Super-resolution (2-4 times better resolution)
3. Transfer learning: from cell to tissue scaling

_Intro:_
Raman: prohibitive acquisition times for high spatial resolution.
Previously, deep learning is used for segmentation of Raman images, identification of species in images.
Complex spatial and spectral correlations in images justify the use of deep learning.

âš  How *general* can this workflow be?

* Denoising
Denoising was achieved with a 1D ResUNet.
