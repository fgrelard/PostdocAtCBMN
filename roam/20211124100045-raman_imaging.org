Acquisition with a confocal microscope.

[[id:14c33ce6-5427-4900-ae3d-0e00e286385d][Raman]] image: pixelized image.
- Pixel size depends on intrinsic limitations (e.g. diffraction limit). Can be improved by image processing.
- Pixel color: monochromatic image. Can be band frequency, band intensity, band shape (width, Lorentzian, Gaussian).

_Pros_:
- Good spatial resolution

_Limitations:_
- acquisition time can be long (~10h)
- problem with fluorescence emission
