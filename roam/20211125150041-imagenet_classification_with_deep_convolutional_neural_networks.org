#+title: Imagenet Classification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

_Introduced_:
- Usage of the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function to mitigate the gradient vanishing effect.
- Dropout: remove useless neurons, to reduce overfitting
- Data augmentation: artificially augment the data by applying linear transformations, to reduce overfitting.
