#+title: Spatial chemometrics and comprehensive chemical imaging based molecular histopathology delineates anatomical heterogeneity at single pixel resolution
#+filetags: :literature:

_Goal_: [[id:14805012-e9b8-491a-9b56-c4830c1d9685][Fusion]] of [[id:fc865bc6-4c84-4d9f-8d67-21980ff47424][MSI]] and [[id:bee298b2-9c52-4613-a8c2-4dbca24c15fc][H&E]] images.
Several MSI modalities for peptides, negative and positive lipids.

* Semi-automatic [[id:08e9482a-8139-41ee-bac5-ce37fbb4b335][registration]]

Using PCA score images as reference images for each modality.
1. Images aligned manually coarsely
2. Automatic iconic image registration:
   - Optimizer: 1+1 evolutionary.
   - Metric: MSE of Mattes Mutual information.
   - Transformation: Affine
     
* [[id:74e38001-568b-42ec-a8f2-bb8a4f39013a][Statistical analysis]]

Monoblock method:
- PCA
  
[[id:ac8d4e14-61f1-4b37-8829-186b6938f4ca][Multiblock]] methods:
- O2PLS: two way orthogonal partial least squares
- OnPLS: multiblock orthogonal projections to latent structures

OnPLS components describe variation in globally joint, locally joint, and unique parts for each data block as follows:
\[
X_i = X_{global} + X_{local} + X_{unique} + E
\]

High resolution predictions of images were obtained using OPLS model based on a decomposition of the microscopy image and a low resolution image from the MSI.

Microscopy: RGB images were extended with RGB transformation (YIQ, YCbCr, ...) and PCA scores. The reduced matrix was down sampled by affine transformation to the MSI resolution.

OnPLS used to find correlations between different MSI datasets:

And then used with microscopy, for [[id:fc8784c1-b2bb-42ce-aebe-3811bd882dca][super-resolution]] images.
