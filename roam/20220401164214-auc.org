#+title: AUC

Usually computed using the trapezoidal rule.

The integral is approximated as:
\[
\int_a^b f(x)dx = (b - a) \cdot \frac{1}{2} (f(a) + f(b))
\]

Assuming f(a) < f(b):
The area between point a and b is given as the sum of the area of the rectangle with f(a) and the area of the triangle given by f(a) f(b) and (b, f(a)).
