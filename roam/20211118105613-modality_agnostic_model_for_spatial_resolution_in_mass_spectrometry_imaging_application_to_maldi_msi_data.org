#+title: Modality agnostic model for spatial resolution in mass spectrometry imaging: application to maldi msi data

[[id:e28dff04-92c1-46c1-9649-1215749d4542][literature]] [[id:e15689e6-2f65-47a1-bd70-819b722d8083][spatial resolution]]

_Aim:_ to determine spatial resolution of MS images.
The spatial resolution is understood as something different than the pixel size, here. The matrix is consumed: the information can overlap between pixels. When the pixel size is lower than the laser crater diameter, the spatial resolution is greater than the pixel size. Lowering the pixel size comes with a signal loss, due to overlapping spectra. A number reflecting the actual measurable signal is necessary. It is called /spatial resolution/ in the following, but also called /lateral resolution/ in other works.

In previous works, [[cite:&Fagerer_2015]] use a scaling distance bar to assess the spatial resolution.

The spatial resolution is defined as the minimum distance where the lines are distinguishable.

Other techniques try to estimate the noise level in the image, so as to predict the amount of signal overlap between pixels. [[cite:&Senoner_2010]] and
[[cite:&Passarelli_2014]] deduce a Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) which maps an object with known (usually constant) intensities to the associated image with contrast variations: $\text{MTF} = \dfrac{C_{\text{image}}(f)}{C_{\text{object}}(f)}$, where C denotes the contrast.

These models consider that the beam is stationary. In this article, the authors propose a model to estimate the spatial resolution with a moving beam.
They conclude that:
- resolution and noise increase with decreasing pixel size
- resolution  and noise increase with the intensity

  
Value   ★★☆☆☆
