Overview of the acquisition techniques: MALDI, DESI, SIMS, LAESI...

* Present applications
Two main approaches:
- Histology driven: use histology images to delineate ROI and study spectral profiles in that region
- Data driven: from the MSI data, get spectral signatures which can be used to annotate the sample
** Biomarker discovery or identification
Find molecules that are a signature for a disease.
** Molecular histology
Creating annotation of tissues from molecular signatures in MSI.
Mostly proteins. Other molecules begin to gain traction.
** Real time tissue classification
DESI to classify brain tumor patients
