#+title: ROC
Receiver Operating Characteristic

Univariate analysis.

Graph plotting the true positive rate (TPR) as a function of false positive rate (FPR)
TPR=pixels inside ROI (1) correctly identified
FPR=pixels outside ROI (0) incorrectly identified

Usually, the intensities are partitioned in bins.

We sort each value in ascending order.
We check whether each pixel is above this value. This gives a binary array (True or False).
We compare this array to the binary mask corresponding to the ROI, using FPR and TPR.
Then we plot TPR=f(FPR) = ROC Curve.

Then we can obtain the [[id:4b382e44-cf4e-4ca2-8559-36facd18f213][AUC]], giving ions that are specifically distributed in the area.
