#+title: ROC
Receiver Operating Characteristic

Univariate analysis.

Graph plotting the true positive rate (TPR) as a function of false positive rate (FPR)
TPR=pixels inside ROI (1) correctly identified
FPR=pixels outside ROI (0) incorrectly identified

Usually, the intensities are partitioned in bins.

For each bin, we have a pixel value associated to it.
I.e. 0, 50, 100, 150,, 250...

We check whether each pixel is above this value. This gives a binary array (True or False).
We compare this array to the binary mask corresponding to the ROI, using FPR and TPR.
Then we plot TPR=f(FPR) = ROC Curve.
