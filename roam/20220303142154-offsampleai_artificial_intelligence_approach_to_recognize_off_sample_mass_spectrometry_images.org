_Aim:_ to remove signal from background, or out-of-sample (=offsample)

Datasets: 87 public MS imaging datasets (various technologies and samples)

Annotation: tagging ON or OFF-sample ion images by experts.

Then 3 methods:
- spatiomolecular biclustering: clustering according to both spatial and spectral info. Spatial=offsample molecules have similar distribution. Spectral=offsample pixels have similar molecular distributions.
- molecular colocalization methods: cosine distance on ion images, then clustering.
- deep residual learning method: ResNet50. Residual learning=faster training.

  Deep learning outperforms the others.
