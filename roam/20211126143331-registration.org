Find the geometrical transformation which aligns two or more images.

* Automatic methods
They involve different components:
1. the geometrical transform: rigid, affine, deformable.
2. similarity metric: quantitative comparison of the two images.
3. optimization: minimization of the metric.

   Find the best transformation parameters iteratively. The transformation parameters are found by optimization of the similarity metric. Two categories of similarity metric exist:
   1) geometrical: based on the shape of the object.

   2) intensity: *iconic* registration methods. Based on the sum of squared differences, Mattes mutual information...

      The optimization can be done by various algorithms, such as the gradient descent, one plus one evolutionary...

* Semi-automatic methods
Landmarks, etc.
