Assumption: spectra are generated by a random process that involves an unobserved latent variable $z$. Following normal distribution. 

- Encoder for variational inference (~dimension reduction?), yields recognition model.

- Decoder for unsupervised learning and data reconstruction given only the the generative model's parameters.

  Find five embedded features (is this enough?)

c: embedded features (~component images)
d: difference between observed and predicted m/z
e: histology with tumor delineation, f: gaussian mixture model clustering, g: selection of the tumor cluster, h: m/z which correlate the most with this cluster.
