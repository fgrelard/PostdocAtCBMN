_Goal_: to obtain a 3D MSI dataset in which to find spectral  signatures.

The authors combine MRI and MSI data in order to identify the molecular distribution in different cell compartments in 3D. The shape is segmented in the MALDIMS image by a hierarchical version of the t-[[id:e95fd377-dd05-4363-8eca-b00b003524ff][SNE ]]algorithm, which builds different levels of detail across several ion images. This segmented shape is registered onto the MRI image with a [[id:f886a4c4-e7ce-4363-9cd8-829a71ce5ee2][deformable registration]] method. Correspondences with the MRI are established *visually*.

âš  Manual step

The registration is done from the MSI onto the MR image.
