#+title: MDS

Means of visualizing the level of similarity in individual cases of a dataset.
Non-linear [[id:71035313-ca28-4397-8084-15dc5840e0c7][dimensionality reduction technique]].

Given a distance matrix between each pair of objects, and a given desired $N$ number of dimensions, an MDS algorithm places each object nto N-dimensional space such that the between-distance object distances are preserved.

Given distances $d_{ij}$, we want to find MDS coordinates to minimize the following function:
\[
\text{Stress}(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \sqrt{\sum_{i \neq j} (d_{ij} - \| x_i - x_j \|)^2
\]
