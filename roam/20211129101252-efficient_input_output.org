#+title: Efficient input/output

Centroided images with high spatial resolution still do not fit in memory.
We need to read the images *on the fly*, in a time-efficient manner.

Need to implement [[id:82fbac32-a53c-4862-bfe2-4ca99fbd93fe][Memory-mapped files]] for [[id:5693a566-f4ec-42c1-8932-bdcbd35d68e5][imzML]].

The memory-mapped file contains:
- The full spectra
- The shape of the spectra
- The coordinates for which the spectra are non zero
- The hyperspectral image

Even though the memory is mapped to a file, this causes huge RAM consumption. This is due to [[https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166][a problem with WSL]]. A temporary fix involves limiting the maximum amount of RAM usable by WSL:

File ~C:/Users/%USERNAME%/.wslconfig~:
#+begin_src 
  [wsl2]
  memory=18GB
#+end_src
