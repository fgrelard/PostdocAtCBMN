#+title: Connecting imaging mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance imaging-based anatomical atlases for automated anatomical interpretation and differential analysis
#+filetags: :literature:

 They build a brain atlas by co-registering MSI and MRI images. First, the brain in the MS image is segmented by extracting a representative image. This image corresponds to a manually selected score image from the principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the MS image. Then, the representative image is registered onto the MRI image using a deformable method. 

 âš  Manual step in selecting the appropriate ion image.
