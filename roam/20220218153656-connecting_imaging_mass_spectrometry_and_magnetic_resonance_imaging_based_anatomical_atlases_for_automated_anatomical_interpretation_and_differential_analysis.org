Brain atlas in MRI.

 They build a brain atlas by co-registering MSI and MRI images. First, the brain in the MS image is segmented by extracting a representative image. This image corresponds to a manually selected score image from the principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the MS image. Then, the representative image is registered onto the MRI image using a [[id:f886a4c4-e7ce-4363-9cd8-829a71ce5ee2][deformable]] method. 

 âš  Manual step in selecting the appropriate ion image.

*  [[id:0e94cff9-50fa-425c-b0fc-a35bdb16cd0d][Statistical analysis]]
Wilcoxon rank sum test to find differently expressed ions over healthy and diseases brain hemispheres.

Automated anatomical interpretation automatically identifies the
spatial distributions observed in any registered ion image as a combination of the anatomical structures described in the atlas. Each ion image is the weighted sum of anatomical images. Optimization problem.
