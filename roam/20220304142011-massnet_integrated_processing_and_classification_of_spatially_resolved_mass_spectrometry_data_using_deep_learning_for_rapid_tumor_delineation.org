Deep learning on the full dataset without having to peak pick before.
Use H&E to transfer the annotations onto MSI images manually.

X = spectra
Y = annotation, i.e. normal and tumor.

massNet: two main modules:
- variational autoencoder to find a lower dimensional representation of the dataset, with encoder and decoder, see [[cite:&Abdelmoula_2021]]
- class prediction: tumor or normal

  Classification (class prediction) is achieved by.
