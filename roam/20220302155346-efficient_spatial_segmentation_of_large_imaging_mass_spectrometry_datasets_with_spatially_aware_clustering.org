#+title: Efficient spatial segmentation of large imaging mass spectrometry datasets with spatially aware clustering
#+filetags: :literature:

_Goal_: get rid of noise.
_Approach_: use a neighborhood around each point, with a gaussian weighting function.

Uses [[id:01d316b0-1af3-4a59-9ac2-df5e4e3cff7d][Fastmap]] to reduce redundancy in the spectra.

1. Create vectors for each spectra taking into account a weighted neighborhood
2. Project each spectrum using FastMap and a given number of components
3. Cluster the projected spectra using k-means.
