#+title: Inverse problems

Acquisition system â†’ measured signal.
There are *perturbations* in the measured signal.

_Inverse problem_: to go back from the measured signal to the information of interest.

$y = \kappa(x, e)$ ou $y = Kx + e$, $y$ measured signal, $e$ errors, $x$ information to recover. $K$ linear application.

_Three conditions_ for inversion: stability, unicity, solution existence.

Regularized inversion: add hypotheses or information.
- Bayesian inference: (likelihood $\times$ /a priori/): *statistics*
- Minimization of a composite criterion (adjustment + penalization): *energy, variational*

_Bayesian inference_:
Which probabilistic models? Which strategy of statistical estimation (large datasets)? How to reduce computation time?

_Mathematical optimization_:
Convergence speed and computation cost? Global optimum vs local optimum? Evolution of computation tools?
