_Goal_:  class comparison. Detect analytes that have different intensities across different conditions. Differentially abundant ions.

Statistical analysis must match the research goal.
Statistical analysis must match the experimental design: other modalities, number of replicates. Must be defined in advance.
Statistical analysis must match the existing sources of variation: noise, inter- and intra-subject variation.

*Class comparison* is usually done by [[id:8e1c9185-edd2-4acc-b8a3-08891175b304][supervised learning]].
 
Finding regions with homogeneous chemical composition translates into the statistical goal of *class discovery*. It is achieved with unsupervised analysis, e.g., Principal
Component Analysis (PCA).

Predicting the condition of each individual location on a tissue, or of the entire tissue, translates into the statistical goal of class prediction. This is the only statistical
goal appropriate for discovery of biomarkers of a disease. Similarly to class comparison, this statistical goal is achieved with supervised analysis (PLS-DA).

For class comparison, the authors design multiple models. They include spatial autocorrelation (the fact that neighboring pixels have similar spectra).
Using Hierarchical Bayesian spatial models.
