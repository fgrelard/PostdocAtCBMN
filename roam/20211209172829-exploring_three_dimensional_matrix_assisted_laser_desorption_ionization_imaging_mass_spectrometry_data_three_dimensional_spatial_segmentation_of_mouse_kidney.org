Image segmentation, automatic prealignment using PCA, registration.

Serial sections in MS are registered on microscopy images by rigid registration.

MSI suffers from strong spectrum to spectrum variability.
_Problem_: raster scan of the data. The intensity of a pixel corresponds to a laser position. Requires adapted methods.

_Solution_: distance-based denoising: calculate for each spot its spatial nearest neighbors.
_Approach_:
1. Median value of intensities of its six spatial neighbors.
2. Total variation (TV) minimizing method.
   TV is defined as the sum of absolute differences of intensities between neighboring spots.

Spatial segmentation by [[id:2fc4674b-a17d-4ff8-bd0b-81cf59175e74][clustering]].

Algorithm called bisecting k-means.
First iteration: division of the dataset into two clusters. Then, each cluster is divided into two subclusters. The iterations continue until each cluster contains only one spectrum.
This produces a binary search tree.
