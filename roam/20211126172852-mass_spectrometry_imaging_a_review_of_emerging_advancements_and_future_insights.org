* [[id:d2b9b7d4-9937-476e-9b37-7db31de14d23][Sample preparation]]
Techniques that allowed for better reproducibility.
* Developments in Instrumentalization
* [[id:0f70126b-dac2-4373-8562-9a70355d4147][Quantitation]]
Difference between relative (semi quantitative) and absolute quantitation (internal standard).

Normalization is expected.
Using reporter ions is another possibility.

"Relatively underdeveloped" at of the date of publication.
* Data analysis
* Multimodal imaging
* Biological applications
