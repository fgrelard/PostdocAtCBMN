#+title: MSM

Combines spectral and spatial measures.

1. For an ion, generate its isotopic pattern.
2. Extract ion images associated to all isotopic peaks.

MSM is computed by multiplying:
1. Variant of [[id:aae16ce7-a4ca-4dc3-a612-7be5667a3dbb][spatial chaos]]: spatial informativeness within the principal peak.
2. Spectral isotope measure: quantifies spectral similarity between a theoretical isotopic patten and relative sampled isotopic intensities
3. Spatial isotope measure: quantifies spatial colocalization between isotopic ion images.

The MSM of 1 quantifies the maximal likelihood of the signal to correspond to the ion.

   
* Spatial chaos
Modified version of [[cite:&Alexandrov_2013]]. Several thresholds. Extract objects. Objects shrink in size as threshold increases. Inspired by persistent homology.

Count the number of objects with 4 connectivity.

Then $\rho_{chaos} = 1 - \dfrac{\sum_{levels} n_{objects}}{n_{pixels} * n_{levels}}$

* Spectral isotope measure
Average difference between normalized predicted isotope ratios and normalized measured intensities. First, vectors are normalized by their L2-norm. Then, the average of the ion image associated is computed.
Vectors theoretical: $T = [t_1, t_2, ..., t_n]$
Vectors measured: $O = [o_1, o_2, ..., o_n]$

Then $\rho_{spectral} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \sum \| O - T \|_1$

* Spatial isotope measure
Weighted average of Pearson correlation between ion image of most intense peak $b_1$ and all others $b_i$. Correlation is weighted by $\alpha_i$ the relative abundance of the peak (w.r.t. the largest peak?)

$\rho_{spatial} = \dfrac{1}{\sum{\alpha_i}} \sum \alpha_i corr(b_1, b_i)$

* MSM
Combination of the measures:
\[
MSM = \rho_{chaos} * \rho_{spectral} * \rho_{spatial}
\]
