#+title: Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding

t-SNE problem: computationally intractable for large datasets.

HSNE creates a hierarchical representation of the non linear data: broad features on higher levels of the hierarchy, and finer details on the lower levels.
Keeps both memory and computational complexities manageable.

Method:
Computes first level of hierarchy, by building a Finite Markov Chain (FMC) from a k-nearest neighbor graph to encode similarities between landmarks.
An "area of influence" is computed for each landmark and the overlap between these areas indicates similarities and serves as a basis for new FMC encodings. These new encodings are used to compute the next scale in the hierarchy.
