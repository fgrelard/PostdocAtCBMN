** Data analysis
*** Large [[id:3da2a1bd-8e61-4872-af07-76853ee992e7][dimensionality]]
Large datasets → need run time and memory efficient methods.
*** [[id:b46c43ee-9b6d-4845-bd81-ceb93f9e1bad][Signal modelling]]
It would help to have models that describe the signal. It would be easier to process the resulting signal.
Allows for the usage of model-based [[id:e7bbf20a-26b0-4b82-9bfa-98fe5d47d547][classification]].
** [[id:b962b560-9c85-4e67-849b-4f848e6376ec][Quality assurance]]
Estimate the quality of an image or a spectrum.
