* Registration
Microscopy to IMS using autofluorescence as an intermediate image.
Two autofluorescence images before /and/ after MSI acquisition.

Several steps:
1. Registration from microscopy onto pre-acquisition AF
2. Registration of pre-acquisition AF onto post-acquisition AF
3. Upsampling of the MSI image
4. Registration of microscopy modalities onto MSI.

After step 2, the microscopy modalities are all aligned on the same grid.

For step 2, the images come from the same modality, so they share the same type of information. They are registered using iconic registration methods (linear gradient descent).

For step 4, landmarks are selected using laser ablation marks.

This is done to:
- avoid artefacts induced in MSI during registration
- preserve the resolution of microscopy images

  
* [[id:0e94cff9-50fa-425c-b0fc-a35bdb16cd0d][Statistical analysis]]
Adds another deformable registration step between AutoFluorescence image.

This deformation is then applied to the MSI ion images.

Then two different MSI datasets can be compared.

Overlap (definition?) is computed to establish [[id:8d07df0d-3aac-4797-8253-751aa8bfd7b7][spatial correlations]]. Ions are ranked according to their degree of overlap.
