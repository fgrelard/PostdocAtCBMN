#+title: Spectral correlations

Can use cosine distance, euclidean distance or Pearson correlation.

Euclidean distance reflects differences in terms of intensities. More intense ions will be different from low ones, even though they have a similar profile.

Cosine distance captures similar trends between vectors. It is not dependent on the raw difference between intensity values. However, it is sensitive to shifts.
$x \cdot y \neq x+1 \cdot y$.

Pearson correlation is the cosine distance on centered vectors. It is not sensitive to shifts and scale.
