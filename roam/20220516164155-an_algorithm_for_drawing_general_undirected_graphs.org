#+title: An algorithm for drawing general undirected graphs
#+filetags: :literature:

Force directed layout for graphs.

Each node is considered as a spring which shouldn't be stretched or condensed too much away from its relaxed state.

Optimization algorithm, i.e. minimize the following energy:

\[
E = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^n \frac{1}{2} k_{ij} \left( \| p_i - p_j \| - l_{ij} \right)^2
\]

The original length $l_{ij}$ corresponds to the desirable length between nodes in the drawing.
Let $d_{ij}$ be the shortest-path distance between two points $p_i$ et $p_j$ in the graph.

Then:
\[
 l_{ij} = L \times d_{ij}
\].
