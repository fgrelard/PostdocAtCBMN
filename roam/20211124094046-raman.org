Photon diffusion (energy exchange between photons and sample):
- elastic (Rayleigh)
- inelastic : Stokes and Anti-Stokes

[[id:f7452c04-a7cd-4d83-8b4d-b2f5c0681153][Vibrational frequencies]] tell about the chemical group nature.

The Raman intensity depend on incident intensity of photons, molecular polarizability.
Simplified as the product of $\sigma$ Raman cross section (intensity+polarizability), $F$ Factor depending on the measurements conditions, $C$ scatterers density (probed volume).
