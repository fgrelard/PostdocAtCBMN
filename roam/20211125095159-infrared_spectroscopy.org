#+title: Infrared spectroscopy
_Different types of vibrations:_
- Elongation vibrations: atomes change positions along their axes. This change can be symmetric or asymmetric.
- Déformation vibrations: angle variation between two atom bindings.
Vibration number: $3n-6$ and $3n-5$ for a linear molecule.

Quantitative analysis: calibration curve based on the absorbance of a reference species.

_Spectral range_: 4000 à 400 cm-1.
